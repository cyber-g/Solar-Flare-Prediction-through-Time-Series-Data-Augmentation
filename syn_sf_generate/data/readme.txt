The distributions of the samples:

X_inputs1.pck: only 385 X samples

Sampled_inputs4.pck: 
385 samples * 4 classes(X, M, B/C, Q)

Sampled_inputs5.pckï¼š
X: 385 samples
M:3860 samples
B/C: 1930 + 1930 samples
Q: 3860 samples

the Sampled_inputs5.pck are too big to upload, simply run Data preprocessing/ReadTrainData.py and change the setting of the number of samples for each class to get it.
