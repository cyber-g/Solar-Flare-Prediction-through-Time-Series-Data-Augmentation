Goal: binary classification between real samples and synthetic samples
how to do: Choose the synthetic samples generated by specific data augmentation methods that show the best performances for each deep learning model, and perform binary classification on real+synthetic samples, where #real == #synthetic

1. apply models to get results: python3 r_s_binary.py run_all
2. store the results in CSV files: python3 r_s_binary.py generate_results_csv
3. plot error bar figures: python3 error_bar.py
